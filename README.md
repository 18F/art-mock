# Gatsby Starter with US Web Design System (USWDS)

A [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) starter with [US Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/).

Kick off your project with this default boilerplate. This starter template currently includes support for writing pages in Markdown and API Sandbox using Swagger UI. Please checkback later as we add more support.

You may checkout the demo app at https://uswds-gatsby-apidocs-starter.softrams.cloud.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using the default starter
    gatsby new my-default-starter https://github.com/softrams/uswds-gatsby-apidocs-starter
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd my-default-starter/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-default-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## Pages

You can create additional pages in Markdown in docs folder, that are automatically added to menu (under Pages). Default starter comes with three pages for example.

## API Sandbox with Swagger UI

Swagger UI is included for sharing API Documentation and offering a ready to use API Sandbox. Just replace the swagger.json file from static/assets folder. For additional updates or configuration of Swagger UI, please refer to pages/swagger.js file.
